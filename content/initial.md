# About me

Hi, my name is Assaf.

This is a place I'd like to share some of my thoughts and talk about random stuff that interests me.

Those would probably be mainly about:

* Gaming
* Programming
* Music
* Movies
* Books
* Food
* Travel
* Technology

But the thing is, I don't really know what to talk about. I feel like I've got nothing interesting to say, really. I do have many thoughts about many different subject, but I feel like they're all shallow and boring.

Getting to start writing about stuff is really difficult. 

Like every other craft, the key is to start doing it and do it a lot. 

Some tips to myself when starting to write about stuff:

* Set your expectations right - you're not going to write a masterpiece book while devoting 1 hour to site and write something. The main idea here is to make it a habit and do it every day. The outcome will vary and muse will be different.
* Don't over criticize yourself - self criticism will only get in your way. Remember, the point of it is getting better as time goes on, and the root assumption is that practice makes perfect. You can't learn from mistakes if you don't make them. Having that little voice in your head that's saying "don't do this, this is stupid" isn't helpful. So what if it's stupid? You don't have to publish it, let your mind juices flow, nothing bad will happen.
* Enjoy the act of doing, not the outcome - the outcome of what you do doesn't matter in the short term. We all do stuff everyday that is "useless", we just burn time. But believing in the "practice makes perfect" mantra, you'll enjoy the mere fact that you practiced, not the outcome of the day. Highly professional individuals always make their craft look easy because they mastered it over the span of years. But if you'd have a magical magnifying glass that would make you see every step of the way, you'll see a tedious, methodical, long process of training and mastering the basics. Everything is simple and easy if you break it down into a small enough resolution.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help - you'll get a lot of help from people who are willing to help you.
* You don't have to have the entire plan mapped out when starting to do something - it's OK to experiment without know exactly what you're doing.
